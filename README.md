test typing speed

connect javascript to index class/id: -> has issues with the connections not working/ not working correctly
None of the js is working right now, currently trying to fix timer

-  text box change color when mismatched
-  reset button
-  timer (start, end, leading 0) 
-  spell checker
-  start button
-  leading zero
-  change inner html of text on click

functions to add:
- make user change text on click of button, by typing in the text box

to fix:
- test-wrapper is at side, not centered
- test the consts in .js -> they might not be connecting correctly
- check the names of the ids and classes -> might be wrong and source of the connection problem
- connection issues still happening
